Here's a list of all the stuff we need to do.

 ! Get the Cabal file working
 ! Get Franchise to play nicely with Cabal and two targets (lib and exe)
 - More redirects (deal with fd's correctly...)
 ! Haddock target
 - Impossible macro
 ! Work out EOT
 - Move bad substitution error from parser into expander
 - While sourcing, parse or other error should quit; failing exit code doesn't
 ! Figure out what's going on with fatal/non-fatal parse errors - tests?
 - SIGPIPE and other signals!
 ! Overhaul ShellProcess...

Tests Needed:
 - Parse issues, including robust recovery from fatal errors
 - Using empty > to create files
 - Positional/special parameters
 - Exports, variable flags, setting/unsetting, readonly

Known Issues:
 - set -e seems to cause some threads to block indefinitely...?
   -> problem is that evaluating "ec/=ExitSuccess" in checkE is
      never terminating...
   -> NO... it's some other thread - the error happens at exitWith...?
 - incorrect semantics in setEnv (ie. unset of exported vs readonly
      vars in bash...?)

=======================

BUG: brace groups don't thread properly
  echo | { cat; echo; }
This blocks indefinitely - why?

Invoking externals doesn't help:
  echo | { /bin/cat; echo; }

If we ever use command substitution inside a brace, it gets worse!
  echo | { `which cat`; echo; }
Now we get "hClose: resource vanished (Broken pipe)" errors, and
nothing ever works again (stdout appears to be closed!)

=======================

Darcs test suite results (conformant scripts, at least)

TODO:
 - figure out pipes through braces (and subshells)
 - fix echo
 - implement [
 - implement a better date
 - implenent & (!!!) (even w/o job control...?)
 - implement sigpipe
 - fix touch
