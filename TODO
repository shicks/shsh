Here's a list of all the stuff we need to do.

 - Get the Cabal file working
 - Get Franchise to play nicely with Cabal and two targets (lib and exe)
 - More redirects (deal with fd's correctly...)
 - Implement positional parameters
 - Haddock target
 - Variable attributes (exported, read-only (e.g.  $-))
 - Impossible macro
 - Work out EOT
 - Move bad substitution error from parser into expander
 - Heredoc ordering
 - While sourcing, parse or other error should quit; failing exit code doesn't
 - Test suits for these issues.
 - Figure out what's going on with fatal/non-fatal parse errors - tests?

More later...
