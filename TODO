Here's a list of all the stuff we need to do.

 - Get the Cabal file working
 - Get Franchise to play nicely with Cabal and two targets (lib and exe)
 - More redirects (deal with fd's correctly...)
 - Haddock target
 - Variable attributes (exported, read-only (e.g.  $-))
 - Impossible macro
 - Work out EOT
 - Move bad substitution error from parser into expander
 - While sourcing, parse or other error should quit; failing exit code doesn't
 - Figure out what's going on with fatal/non-fatal parse errors - tests?
 - Use own path, rather than (immutable) system path...
 - SIGPIPE and other signals!
 - Overhaul ShellProcess...

Tests Needed:
 - Parse issues, including robust recovery from fatal errors
 - Using empty > to create files
 - Positional/special parameters
 - Exports, variable flags, setting/unsetting, readonly

Known Issues:
 - set -e seems to cause some threads to block indefinitely...?
   -> problem is that evaluating "ec/=ExitSuccess" in checkE is
      never terminating...
   -> NO... it's some other thread - the error happens at exitWith...?
 - incorrect semantics in setEnv (ie. unset of exported vs readonly
      vars in bash...?)
