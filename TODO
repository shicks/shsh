Here's a list of all the stuff we need to do.

 - Get the Cabal file working
 - Get Franchise to play nicely with Cabal and two targets (lib and exe)
 - Globs
 - More redirects (deal with fd's correctly...)
 - Implement positional parameters
 - Haddock target
 - Variable attributes (exported, read-only (e.g.  $-))
 - Impossible macro
 - Work out EOT
 - Move bad substitution error from parser into expander
 - Wrap all builtins into withExitHandler correctly...?
 - Heredocs
 - While sourcing, parse or other error should quite; failing exit code doesn't

More later...
