Logic and exit codes
====================

Here are some test cases for logic, pipes and grep.

~~~~ check-output/logic.sh
true && echo true works
true || echo true fails

false && echo false fails
false || echo false works

echo hello | grep goodbye && echo pipe bad grep fails
echo hello | grep goodbye || echo pipe bad grep works

echo hello | grep hell && echo pipe good grep works
echo hello | grep hell || echo pipe good grep fails

echo hello | grep foo | true && echo complicated pipe works
echo hello | grep foo | true || echo complicated pipe fails
~~~~

~~~~ known-output/logic.sh
true works
false works
pipe bad grep works
hello
pipe good grep works
hello
complicated pipe works
~~~~

Here are some tests of the `$?` environment variable, which currently
fail.

~~~~ check-output/exit-code.sh
false
echo false exit code is $?
~~~~

~~~~ known-output/exit-code.sh
false exit code is 1
~~~~
