Redirecting output of compound commands
=======================================

Here are some test cases involving redirection of output.

~~~~ check-output/redirection.sh
# fails-in-shsh
announce () { "$@" && echo it works || echo it failed; }

announce echo foo bar > out

echo checking out out
cat out
echo grepping from out
grep works out
grep 'foo bar' out
~~~~

~~~~ known-output/redirection.sh
checking out out
foo bar
it works
grepping from out
it works
foo bar
~~~~
