Redirections
============

Test cases for various redirection operators, including heredocs

~~~~ check-output/redir1.sh
mkdir tmp
cd tmp

cat <<EOF >foo
baz
foo
bar
EOF

sort <foo

cat <<EOF >>foo
dog
EOF

sort <foo
~~~~

~~~~ known-output/redir1.sh
bar
baz
foo
bar
baz
dog
foo
~~~~

This is tricky - it's possible to have multiple heredocs even without
funny business with file descriptors:

~~~~ check-output/redir2.sh
# fails-in-bash
$(cat <<EOF) <<EOF
cat
EOF
foo
EOF
~~~~

~~~~ known-output/redir2.sh
foo
~~~~
