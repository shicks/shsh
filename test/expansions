Expansions
==========

This is a test for more general expansions, and general parsing
matters.

~~~~ ../tmp/expansions1.sh
echo $(echo $(( 1+2 ) ))
# dash: waits for closing ) then can't parse " 1+2 ) "
# bash: reinterprets $(( as $( (
~~~~

The moral of the story so far: we need to be smartly lexing inside
command substitutions, and not just scooping up strings until we
balance the unescaped parens.

Note that there's a sticky parsing point in parsing "b=" on a line to itself.
Specifically, we need to allow such /incomplete/ assignments, with no word
on the RHS.
