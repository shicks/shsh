\title{shsh: The Simple Haskell Shell}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

This is the Simple Haskell Shell.  It aims to provide a portable,
native, \texttt{sh} replacement, independent of tools such as cygwin.
This should be useful for, e.g. test scripts, among other things.

A specification of \texttt{sh} can be found at
\texttt{http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/utilities/sh.html}.
The plan currently is to base the implementation off of the main points
of that specification.

\let\inputHs\relax % implement this someday...?
