<h2>Simple Haskell Shell</h2>
<p>This is a project to create a portable sh-like shell.  One purpose is
for writing portable test-suites that work the same on both unix and
windows environments.  A particular advantage is that shsh requires
only a Haskell compiler to build on windows machines, and ultimately,
we hope, will eliminate the need for cygwin/msys in many cases.</p>

<p>To get a current version of shsh, please run<br/>
<pre>  darcs get http://code.haskell.org/shsh</pre><br/>
Patches are always welcome!</p>

<p>We also have a mailing list at
<a href='http://groups.google.com/group/shsh-haskell'
>http://groups.google.com/group/shsh-haskell</a> for user or developer
discussion.</p>

<h3>language-sh</h3>
<p>Language-sh is a haskell package that is co-maintained with shsh,
containing anything pertaining to parsing or (eventually) printing
shell scripts.

<p>This can be downloaded as a separate library on
<a href='http://hackage.haskell.org'>Hackage</a>, or otherwise it
comes in the darcs repository.</p>
