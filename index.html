<h2>Simple Haskell Shell</h2>
<p>This is a project to create a portable sh-like shell.  One purpose is
for writing portable test-suites that work the same on both unix and
windows environments.  A particular advantage is that shsh requires
only a Haskell compiler to build on windows machines, and ultimately,
we hope, will eliminate the need for cygwin/msys in many cases.</p>

<p>To get a current version of shsh, please run<br/>
<pre>  darcs get http://code.haskell.org/shsh</pre>
or download the <a href="shsh.tar.gz">tarball</a>.
We have both a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/franchise-haskell"
>franchise</a> and a cabal build system (though cabal only builds the
library). Patches are always welcome!</p>

<p>We also have a mailing list at
<a href='http://groups.google.com/group/shsh-haskell'
>http://groups.google.com/group/shsh-haskell</a> for user or developer
discussion.</p>

<h3>language-sh</h3>
<p>Language-sh is a haskell package that is co-maintained with shsh,
containing anything pertaining to parsing or (eventually) printing
shell scripts.

<p>This can be downloaded as a separate library on
<a href='http://hackage.haskell.org'>Hackage</a>, or otherwise it
comes in the darcs repository or as a
<a href="language-sh-0.0.3.1.tar.gz">tarball</a></p>

<p><a href="doc/html/language-sh/">Haddock documentation</a> - the doc
comments aren't particularly helpful yet, but at least the types are
viewable.</p>
